# Restaurant Picker
- This is a short code in python 3.7.5 to pick which restaurant is good to visit by users and which one should be avoided and why.
- We have two json files in data folder, one with the list of restaurants available with food and drinks and another json file with the list of users who would like to avoid certain food and the drinks they like
- Based on these two json files, the python code creates a json file with the list of restaurants where all users can go and the ones that should be avoided and why. 
- This python code does not require any additional package to be installed.

# SQL Revenue
- There is also a small sql script which is separate to the above restaurant picker python code. It is developed using mysql:5.7.35
- This SQL code calculates the revenue generated by each product depending on the quality sold and the effective price applied on the date of sale which is stored in prices table.
